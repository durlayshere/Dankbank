### Phase 2.&#x20;

DankBank Plus Subscription&#x20;

Where customers can subscribe to a membership plan where they can get medicinal or recreational cannabis delivered to their front door.&#x20;

### Phase 3.&#x20;

* This phase is going to be the most crucial phase for DankBank.&#x20;

Opening a chain of physical locations.&#x20;

The physical locations will include a cafe, a dispensary, and a bakery.&#x20;

The Joint - A chill Amsterdam style coffee shop where a customer can buy small amounts of cannabis and smoke it within the premises.&#x20;

High on Supply - A dispensary where customers can stock up on their medicinal and recreational cannabis requirements.&#x20;

The Baked - A bakery serving some of the finest and freshest bakery goods along with potent cannabis edibles.&#x20;

The Joint, High on Supply, The Baked; being the holy trinity of the DankBank should be all located under the same roof, but as separate franchises.&#x20;

* DankBank's  innovations to solve major global problems

DankBank will produce hemp from the leftover stems and leaves, which can further be refined to textile, paper etc. This one simple step can help DankBank become a zero waste company and battle deforestation, soil degradation due to the large scale farming of cotton.

DankBank once it can produce its own hemp will also start producing its own smoking accessories, along with other hemp products such as clothing garments, bags etc.&#x20;

DankBank will also continue researching on everything cannabis related.&#x20;

Once all these conditions have been fulfilled, DankBank is truly going to be a self-sustainable company with zero waste.&#x20;

#### The Final Phase.&#x20;

It's a little far fetched, but the last phase for the mission objective is to release a rewards point system called Dank Coins and integrate them as a Crypto Currency.&#x20;
